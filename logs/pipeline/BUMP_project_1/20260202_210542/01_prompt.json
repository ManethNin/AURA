  "prompt": "You are a Java dependency migration expert. A pom.xml file has been updated with new dependencies, causing compilation errors.\n\nPOM.XML CHANGES:\n```diff\ndiff --git a/pom.xml b/pom.xml\nindex 88f8e86..b93dfcf 100644\n--- a/pom.xml\n+++ b/pom.xml\n@@ -63,7 +63,7 @@\n         <dependency>\n             <groupId>com.maxmind.geoip2</groupId>\n             <artifactId>geoip2</artifactId>\n-            <version>2.16.1</version>\n+            <version>3.0.0</version>\n         </dependency>\n         <dependency>\n             <groupId>commons-validator</groupId>\n\n```\n\nYOUR TASK:\n1. Analyze the dependency changes in pom.xml\n2. Look at the ACTUAL file content provided above\n3. Identify what API changes occurred between the old and new versions\n4. Generate a diff that matches the EXACT lines from the actual file content\n5. Fix the Java source code to work with the new dependencies\n6. Validate your changes compile successfully\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL RULES:\n- DO NOT CHANGE versions of existing dependencies in pom.xml\n- The version upgrades are intentional and MUST be kept\n- You MUST update the Java code to be compatible with the NEW versions\n- Reverting dependency versions is FORBIDDEN\n- You MAY ADD new dependencies to pom.xml if needed to fix issues (e.g., adding missing transitive dependencies)\n- When adding dependencies, only add new <dependency> blocks - do NOT modify existing dependency versions\n- Your diff MUST match the exact lines shown in the file content above\n- Include proper context lines for the diff to apply correctly\n\nUse the provided tools to:\n- Validate diffs before applying them (validate_diffs tool)\n- Compile with Maven to check your fixes (compile_maven_stateful tool)\n- Reset the repository if needed to try different approaches\n\nProvide unified diff format changes to fix the Java source code AND/OR add new dependencies to pom.xml if needed.\n",
