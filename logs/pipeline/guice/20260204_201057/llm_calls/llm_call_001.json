      "content": "Act as an expert Java software developer.\nThe program has issues after a version upgrade of a dependency.\nTry using minimal changes to the code to fix the issues. \nDo not explain your actions or ask questions, just provide diffs that always adhere to the rules.\nWhen you think you are done, reply with the diff that fixes the issues, after that a final verification step will happen and the conversation will be ended if it was successful. If not you get the error back.\n\n# CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:\n**DO NOT CHANGE VERSIONS OF EXISTING DEPENDENCIES IN pom.xml.**\nThe dependency version upgrades in pom.xml are intentional and must be kept.\nYou MUST adapt the Java source code to work with the NEW dependency versions.\nReverting dependency versions is NOT an acceptable solution.\n\nHowever, you CAN MODIFY pom.xml to ADD NEW dependencies if needed to fix compilation issues.\nFor example, you may need to add missing transitive dependencies that were removed in version upgrades.\nWhen adding dependencies:\n- Add complete <dependency> blocks with <groupId>, <artifactId>, and <version> tags\n- Place new dependencies in the <dependencies> section\n- Do NOT modify or remove existing dependency versions\n- Only ADD new dependencies, never change or remove existing ones\n\n# File editing rules:\nReturn edits similar to unified diffs that `diff -U0` would produce.\nThe diff has to be in a markdown code block, like this: ```diff ```.\n\nMake sure you include the first 2 lines with the file paths.\nDon't include timestamps with the file paths.\n\nStart each hunk of changes with a `@@ ... @@` line.\nDon't include line numbers like `diff -U0` does.\nThe user's patch tool doesn't need them.\n\nThe user's patch tool needs CORRECT patches that apply cleanly against the current contents of the file!\nThink carefully and make sure you include and mark all lines that need to be removed or changed as `-` lines.\nMake sure you mark all new or modified lines with `+`.\nDon't leave out any lines or the diff patch won't apply correctly.\nDont add in new comments or change existing comments.\nMake sure the diff is minimal and only includes the changes needed to fix the issue plus at least one context line so the tool can apply the diff correctly.\n\nIndentation matters in the diffs!\n\nStart a new hunk for each section of the file that needs changes.\nDont include unnescessary context, but include at least one line of it.\nIf no context is included, the tool will try to apply the changes at the end of the line.\n\nOnly output hunks that specify changes with `+` or `-` lines.\nSkip any hunks that are entirely unchanging ` ` lines.\n\nOutput hunks in whatever order makes the most sense.\nHunks don't need to be in any particular order.\n\nWhen editing a function, method, loop, etc use a hunk to replace the *entire* code block.\nDelete the entire existing version with `-` lines and then add a new, updated version with `+` lines.\nThis will help you generate correct code and correct diffs.\n\nTo make a new file, show a diff from `--- /dev/null` to `+++ path/to/new/file.ext`.\n"
