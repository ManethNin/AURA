You are a Java dependency migration expert. A pom.xml file has been updated with new dependencies, causing compilation errors.

COMPILATION ERRORS:
```
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-remote-resources-plugin:1.1:process (default) on project extensions-parent: Failed to resolve dependencies for one or more projects in the reactor. Reason: Missing:
[ERROR] ----------
[ERROR] 1) com.google.inject:guice:jar:tests:5.1.1-SNAPSHOT
[ERROR]   Try downloading the file manually from the project website.
[ERROR]   Then, install it using the command:

[ERROR]   Alternatively, if you host your own repository you can deploy the file there:

YOUR TASK:
1. Analyze the dependency changes in pom.xml
2. Look at the ACTUAL file content provided above
3. Identify what API changes occurred between the old and new versions
4. Generate a diff that matches the EXACT lines from the actual file content
5. Fix the Java source code to work with the new dependencies
6. Validate your changes compile successfully

⚠️ CRITICAL RULES:
- DO NOT CHANGE versions of existing dependencies in pom.xml
- The version upgrades are intentional and MUST be kept
- You MUST update the Java code to be compatible with the NEW versions
- Reverting dependency versions is FORBIDDEN
- You MAY ADD new dependencies to pom.xml if needed to fix issues (e.g., adding missing transitive dependencies)
- When adding dependencies, only add new <dependency> blocks - do NOT modify existing dependency versions
- Your diff MUST match the exact lines shown in the file content above
- Include proper context lines for the diff to apply correctly

Use the provided tools to:
- Validate diffs before applying them (validate_diffs tool)
- Compile with Maven to check your fixes (compile_maven_stateful tool)
- Reset the repository if needed to try different approaches

Provide unified diff format changes to fix the Java source code AND/OR add new dependencies to pom.xml if needed.
